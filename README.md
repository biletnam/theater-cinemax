A program that can be used by management of Cinemax theater to assign and book seats, and sell tickets for performances.
The cinema has 16 rows, with 20 seats in each row. The seats at the mid-column (number 5 to 15) of the last 2 rows closest to the doors (row A and B) are Twin seats, which will be sold in pair, side by side (e.g., buy A5 means paying for both A5 and A6). The rest of the seats in the row A and B, and all seats in row C to F are Very VIP (VVIP) seats. Row G to L are VIP seats, and row M to Z are Economy seats.
